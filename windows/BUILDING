sedutil is built using autotools and make.

Depending on the distribution, you might need to download some of thises.
For instance, in a new Fedora 42 running ppc64le, this `dnf` command:

sudo dnf install autoconf make g++ automake systemd-devel libnvme-devel


Actual building steps:
autoreconf -i
./configure --enable-silent-rules
make
------------------------
This will also build the PBA ignore it.

If you get an error building that says Version.h is missing
you need to make all. This is an issue with how autotools handles
built sources and dependencies.

You will need superuser privileges to run sedutil-cli in most cases, since it needs to
read the device nodes.  Hence the building user should be able to `sudo`.

An extended Bash command line that builds, tests slightly using --scan, and cleans up, 
and which you can execute by `tail -7 BUILDING | sh`, is:

autoreconf -i                     && \
./configure --enable-silent-rules && \
make                              && \
sudo make install                 && \
ls -al `which sedutil-cli`        && \
sudo sedutil-cli -vv --scan       && \
sudo make clean
